# Docker and Procfile Example

This demonstrates using [Honcho](https://honcho.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) (a port of the [Foreman](http://ddollar.github.io/foreman/) process manager) to run multiple processes in a Docker container.

See [my blog post](tbd) for more information.

## Running

First, copy ``.env.example`` to ``.env`` and enter your Redis server details. Don't have a redis server? Use a free instance from [redislabs](https://redislabs.com) or spin up one yourself on [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/redis/click-to-deploy).
